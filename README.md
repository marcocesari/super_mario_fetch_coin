## V5:

    New Artificial Intelligence mode (genetic algorithm)! 
    Mario clones learn how to catch the coin!

    Features:
    - New game modes: 
        - genetic training: 100+ mario clones compete to pass their (mutated) DNA to their offspring
        - genetic play: let the fittest clone play
        - normal play: you control Mario
        - auto: basic AI (no training), same as V4
    - Switch between game modes by pressing "G"
    - Mario can still jump in any game mode
