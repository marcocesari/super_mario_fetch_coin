## V5:

    New Artificial Intelligence mode (genetic algorithm)! 
    Mario clones learn how to get the coin!

        - genetic play: let the fittest clone play
        - normal play: you control Mario
        - auto: basic AI (no training), same as V4

    - Mario can still jump in any game mode
